# axon-dbconfig-demo
Demo application showing a few different database configurations for Axon, and running a small test.

There are 4 spring profiles available (see application.properties) - one must be enabled to run.

The individual configuration classes in the 'config' package correspond to the profiles and have some more detailed info on how to run.
